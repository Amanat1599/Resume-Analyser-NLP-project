The project entailed\r\nautomating responses to user queries at the earliest. The Monster Bot using the power of Deep Machine Learning,\r\nNLP to handle such queries. User can see the how their queries can be answered quickly like allL1 activities can be\r\neliminated.\r\nEntity Extractor -> This involves text extraction and NLP for fetching out important information from the text like\r\ndates, names, places, contact numbers etc. This involves Regex, Bluemix NLU apiâs and machine learning using\r\nTensor flow for further learning of new entities.\r\nClassifier ->This involves the classifications of classes, training of dataset and predicting the output using the SKLearn\r\nclassifier (MNB, SVM, SGD as Classifier) and SGD for the optimization to map the user queries with the best\r\nsuited response and make the system efficient.\r\nNER: A Deep Learning NER Model is trained to extract the entities from the text. Entities like Roles, Skills,\r\nOrganizations can be extracted from raw text. RNN(LSTM) Bidirectional model is trained for extracting such entities\r\nusing Keras TensorFlow framework.\r\ncompany - Wipro Technologies\r\ndescription - An IT professional with knowledge and experience of 2 years in Wipro Technologies in Machine\r\nLearning, Deep Learning, Data Science, Python, Software Development.\r\nâª Skilled in managing end-to-end development and software products / projects from inception, requirement\r\nspecs, planning, designing, implementation, configuration and documentation.\r\nâª Knowledge on Python , Machine Learning, Deep Learning, data Science, Algorithms, Neural Network,\r\nNLP, GCP.\r\nâª Knowledge on Python Libraries like Numpy, Pandas, Seaborn , Matplotlib, Cufflinks.\r\nâª Knowledge on different algorithms in Machine learning like KNN, Decision Tree, Bias variance Trade off,\r\nSupport vector Machine(SVM),Logistic Regression, Neural networks.\r\nâª Have knowledge on unsupervised, Supervised and reinforcement data.\r\nâª Programming experience in relational platforms like MySQL,Oracle.\r\nâª Have knowledge on Some programming language like C++,Java.\r\nâª Experience in cloud based environment like Google Cloud.\r\nâª Working on different Operating System like Linux, Ubuntu, Windows.\r\nâª Good interpersonal and communication skills.\r\nâª Problem solving skills with the ability to think laterally, and to think with a medium term and long term\r\nperspective\r\nâª Flexibility and an open attitude to change.\r\nâª Ability to create, define and own frameworks with a strong emphasis on code reusability."
